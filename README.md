This is a webpage built as an exercise in realizing a provided design using HTML and CSS.

The following are some skills I demonstrated while completing it.

* Choosing appropriate HTML elements based on a design image.
* Using combinations of block and flex display modes in CSS to achieve a layout from design images.
* Translating the style of elements from design images into CSS.

Some extra additions I made beyond the project requirements:
* Text copy and images in lieu of placeholders.
* Hover effects on links and buttons.
* Experimented with variable font features (namely, the width axis of a font that supports variable width).
* Rough implementation of a flexible/responsive layout using `flex-wrap` and `flex-shrink`.
